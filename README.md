HTML <i> and <em> Elements
The HTML <i> element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

Example
<i>This text is italic</i>
The HTML <em> element defines emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.

Tip: A screen reader will pronounce the words in <em> with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

Example
<em>This text is emphasized</em>

The HTML <small> element defines smaller text:

Example
<small>This is some smaller text.</small>
HTML <mark> Element
